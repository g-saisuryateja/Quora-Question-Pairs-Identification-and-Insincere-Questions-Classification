# Quora-Question-Pairs-Identification-and-Insincere-Questions-Classification

 In this research work, we have proposed a method to
overcome these two challenges by using techniques of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL). Five
different word embeddings were used for both the problems, Bi-
directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Bi-Gated
Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) architecture with attention mechanism
were used for insincere question classification and Siamese
Manhattan Long Short-Term Memory (MaLSTM) architecture
were used for question pairs identification. The implemented
models are performing well, in terms of accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1 Score. Our research work has achieved the
highest accuracy of 90% and highest F1 score of 0.89 by using
Paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 + Siamese MaLSTM for Quora
Question Pairs Identification and for Insincere Questions
Classification our model achieved the highest accuracy of 95%
and highest F1 score of 0.82 by using FastText + BiLSTM +
BiGRU. Our results were compared with literature and our
research work has outperformed baseline models.
